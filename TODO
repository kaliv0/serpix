-----------------------------

to refactor:
- combine classes with similar methods (head, tail; cat, cut) into OOP hierarchies
    -> e.g. extract validate_file, build_message
- extract expected output for tests -> 
- test errors -> inside result.exception.args[0]
- migrate to poetry and remove tox

- reason to separate handle_single_file from handle_multiple 
    -> print header message before each file in the list (as in wc)
    -> although it's not included in the unix original

- add verbose opt to uniq
