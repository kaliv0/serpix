to refactor:
- combine classes with similar methods (head, tail; cat, cut) into OOP hierarchies
- unify functionlities for reading single file and list of files -> use only lists
- extract expected output for tests -> 
- test errors -> inside result.exception.args[0]
- migrate to poetry and remove tox
