grep 
sed 
tr 
sort 
find
-----------------------------

to refactor:
- combine classes with similar methods (head, tail; cat, cut) into OOP hierarchies
    -> e.g. extract validate_file, build_message
- migrate to poetry and remove tox

- reason to separate handle_single_file from handle_multiple 
    -> print header message before each file in the list (as in wc)
    -> although it's not included in the unix original
    -> possibly combine to single function -> read list with one element for single file?

- main reason to support reading from stdin -> possibility to use pipe with other subcommands
    -> not supported in this case -> remove reading from sdtin???

refactor tests:
    -tail
    -wc
